///                        Color pickers now use floating point values to represent
///                        HSV values. To get back the old behavior I added some additional
///                        color conversion functions to cast between nk_color and
///                        nk_colorf.

/// - 2017/07/07 (1.40.4) - Fixed bug in nk_convert trying to add windows that are in
///                        process of being destroyed.
/// - 2017/07/07 (1.40.3) - Fixed table internal bug caused by storing table size in

/// - 2017/06/30 (1.40.1) - Fixed drawing lines smaller or equal zero.
/// - 2017/06/08 (1.40.0) - Removed the breaking part of last commit. Auto layout now only
///                        comes in effect if you pass in zero was row height argument.
/// - 2017/06/08 (1.40.0) - BREAKING CHANGE: while not directly API breaking it will change

///                        row height derived from font height. If you need a row smaller than
///                        that you can directly set it by `nk_layout_set_min_row_height` and
///                        reset the value back by calling `nk_layout_reset_min_row_height.

/// - 2017/01/21 (1.32.2) - Fixed input capture from hidden or closed windows.
/// - 2017/01/21 (1.32.1) - Fixed slider behavior and drawing.

/// - 2017/01/13 (1.31.0) - Added additional row layouting method to combine both
///                        dynamic and static widgets.
/// - 2016/12/31 (1.30.0) - Extended scrollbar offset from 16-bit to 32-bit.

///                        pass in a style struct to change buttons visual.
/// - 2016/11/10 (1.27.0) - Added additional `nk_tree` versions to support external state
///                        storage. Just like last the `nk_group` commit the main
///                        advantage is that you optionally can minimize nuklears runtime
///                        memory consumption or handle hash collisions.
/// - 2016/11/09 (1.26.0) - Added additional `nk_group` version to support external scrollbar
///                        offset storage. Main advantage is that you can externalize
///                        the memory management for the offset. It could also be helpful
///                        if you have a hash collision in `nk_group_begin` but really
///                        want the name. In addition I added `nk_list_view` which allows
///                        to draw big lists inside a group without actually having to
///                        commit the whole list to nuklear (issue #269).
/// - 2016/10/30 (1.25.1) - Fixed clipping rectangle bug inside `nk_draw_list`.
/// - 2016/10/29 (1.25.0) - Pulled `nk_panel` memory management into nuklear and out of
///                        the hands of the user. From now on users don't have to care
///                        about panels unless they care about some information. If you
///                        still need the panel just call `nk_window_get_panel`.
/// - 2016/10/21 (1.24.0) - Changed widget border drawing to stroked rectangle from filled
///                        rectangle for less overdraw and widget background transparency.
/// - 2016/10/18 (1.23.0) - Added `nk_edit_focus` for manually edit widget focus control.
/// - 2016/09/29 (1.22.7) - Fixed deduction of basic type in non `<stdint.h>` compilation.
/// - 2016/09/29 (1.22.6) - Fixed edit widget UTF-8 text cursor drawing bug.
/// - 2016/09/28 (1.22.5) - Fixed edit widget UTF-8 text appending/inserting/removing.
/// - 2016/09/28 (1.22.4) - Fixed drawing bug inside edit widgets which offset all text
///                        text in every edit widget if one of them is scrolled.
/// - 2016/09/28 (1.22.3) - Fixed small bug in edit widgets if not active. The wrong
///                        text length is passed. It should have been in bytes but
///                        was passed as glyphes.
/// - 2016/09/20 (1.22.2) - Fixed color button size calculation.
/// - 2016/09/20 (1.22.1) - Fixed some `nk_vsnprintf` behavior bugs and removed `<stdio.h>`
///                        again from `NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_VARARGS`.
/// - 2016/09/18 (1.22.0) - C89 does not support vsnprintf only C99 and newer as well
///                        as C++11 and newer. In addition to use vsnprintf you have
///                        to include <stdio.h>. So just defining `NK_INCLUDE_STD_VAR_ARGS`
///                        is not enough. That behavior is now fixed. By default if
///                        both varargs as well as stdio is selected I try to use
///                        vsnprintf if not possible I will revert to vsprintf. If
///                        varargs but not stdio was defined I will use my own function.
/// - 2016/09/15 (1.21.2) - Fixed panel `close` behavior for deeper panel levels.
/// - 2016/09/15 (1.21.1) - Fixed C++ errors and wrong argument to `nk_panel_get_xxxx`.
/// - 2016/09/13 (1.21.0) - !BREAKING! Fixed nonblocking popup behavior in menu, combo,
///                        and contextual which prevented closing in y-direction if
///                        popup did not reach max height.
///                        In addition the height parameter was changed into vec2
///                        for width and height to have more control over the popup size.
/// - 2016/09/13 (1.20.3) - Cleaned up and extended type selection.
/// - 2016/09/13 (1.20.2) - Fixed slider behavior hopefully for the last time. This time
///                        all calculation are correct so no more hackery.
/// - 2016/09/13 (1.20.1) - Internal change to divide window/panel flags into panel flags and types.
///                        Suprisinly spend years in C and still happened to confuse types
///                        with flags. Probably something to take note.
/// - 2016/09/08 (1.20.0) - Added additional helper function to make it easier to just
///                        take the produced buffers from `nk_convert` and unplug the
///                        iteration process from `nk_context`. So now you can
///                        just use the vertex,element and command buffer + two pointer
///                        inside the command buffer retrieved by calls `nk__draw_begin`
///                        and `nk__draw_end` and macro `nk_draw_foreach_bounded`.
/// - 2016/09/08 (1.19.0) - Added additional asserts to make sure every `nk_xxx_begin` call
///                        for windows, popups, combobox, menu and contextual is guarded by
///                        `if` condition and does not produce false drawing output.
/// - 2016/09/08 (1.18.0) - Changed confusing name for `NK_SYMBOL_RECT_FILLED`, `NK_SYMBOL_RECT`
///                        to hopefully easier to understand `NK_SYMBOL_RECT_FILLED` and
///                        `NK_SYMBOL_RECT_OUTLINE`.
/// - 2016/09/08 (1.17.0) - Changed confusing name for `NK_SYMBOL_CIRLCE_FILLED`, `NK_SYMBOL_CIRCLE`
///                        to hopefully easier to understand `NK_SYMBOL_CIRCLE_FILLED` and
///                        `NK_SYMBOL_CIRCLE_OUTLINE`.
/// - 2016/09/08 (1.16.0) - Added additional checks to select correct types if `NK_INCLUDE_FIXED_TYPES`
///                        is not defined by supporting the biggest compiler GCC, clang and MSVC.
/// - 2016/09/07 (1.15.3) - Fixed `NK_INCLUDE_COMMAND_USERDATA` define to not cause an error.
/// - 2016/09/04 (1.15.2) - Fixed wrong combobox height calculation.
/// - 2016/09/03 (1.15.1) - Fixed gaps inside combo boxes in OpenGL.
/// - 2016/09/02 (1.15.0) - Changed nuklear to not have any default vertex layout and
///                        instead made it user provided. The range of types to convert
///                        to is quite limited at the moment, but I would be more than
///                        happy to accept PRs to add additional.
/// - 2016/08/30 (1.14.2) - Removed unused variables.
/// - 2016/08/30 (1.14.1) - Fixed C++ build errors.
/// - 2016/08/30 (1.14.0) - Removed mouse dragging from SDL demo since it does not work correctly.
/// - 2016/08/30 (1.13.4) - Tweaked some default styling variables.
/// - 2016/08/30 (1.13.3) - Hopefully fixed drawing bug in slider, in general I would
///                        refrain from using slider with a big number of steps.
/// - 2016/08/30 (1.13.2) - Fixed close and minimize button which would fire even if the
///                        window was in Read Only Mode.
/// - 2016/08/30 (1.13.1) - Fixed popup panel padding handling which was previously just
///                        a hack for combo box and menu.
/// - 2016/08/30 (1.13.0) - Removed `NK_WINDOW_DYNAMIC` flag from public API since
///                        it is bugged and causes issues in window selection.
/// - 2016/08/30 (1.12.0) - Removed scaler size. The size of the scaler is now
///                        determined by the scrollbar size.
/// - 2016/08/30 (1.11.2) - Fixed some drawing bugs caused by changes from 1.11.0.

///                        handling panel padding and panel border.
/// - 2016/08/29 (1.10.0) - Added additional height parameter to `nk_combobox_xxx`.
/// - 2016/08/29 (1.10.0) - Fixed drawing bug in dynamic popups.
/// - 2016/08/29 (1.10.0) - Added experimental mouse scrolling to popups, menus and comboboxes.
/// - 2016/08/26 (1.10.0) - Added window name string prepresentation to account for
///                        hash collisions. Currently limited to `NK_WINDOW_MAX_NAME`
///                        which in term can be redefined if not big enough.
/// - 2016/08/26 (1.10.0) - Added stacks for temporary style/UI changes in code.
/// - 2016/08/25 (1.10.0) - Changed `nk_input_is_key_pressed` and 'nk_input_is_key_released'

///                        window only as selected by hovering and not by clicking.
/// - 2016/08/14 (1.09.2) - Fixed a bug in font atlas which caused wrong loading
///                        of glyphes for font with multiple ranges.

///                        hidden and therefore not visible.

///                        the underlying implementation to not cast to float and instead

/// - 2016/08/09 (1.08.0) - Added additional define to overwrite library internal
///                        floating pointer number to string conversion for additional

/// - 2016/08/08 (1.07.1) - Fixed possible floating point error inside `nk_widget` leading
///                        to wrong wiget width calculation which results in widgets falsly
///                        becomming tagged as not inside window and cannot be accessed.

///                        closing a window (NK_WINDOW_CLOSED). A window can be hidden/shown
///                        by using `nk_window_show` and closed by either clicking the close
///                        icon in a window or by calling `nk_window_close`. Only closed
///                        windows get removed at the end of the frame while hidden windows

///                        wrong item spacing and panel width.
/// - 2016/08/07 (1.05.1) - Hopefully finally fixed combobox popup drawing bug.
/// - 2016/08/07 (1.05.0) - Split varargs away from `NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_IO` into own
///                        define `NK_INCLUDE_STANDARD_VARARGS` to allow more fine
///                        grained controlled over library includes.
/// - 2016/08/06 (1.04.5) - Changed memset calls to `NK_MEMSET`.
/// - 2016/08/04 (1.04.4) - Fixed fast window scaling behavior.

///                        move/scale a window and another window is behind it.
///                        If you are fast enough then the window behind gets activated
///                        and the operation is blocked. I now require activating
///                        by hovering only if mouse is not pressed.

/// - 2016/08/03 (1.04.0) - Added additional window padding style attributes for
///                        sub windows (combo, menu, ...).
/// - 2016/08/03 (1.04.0) - Added functions to show/hide software cursor.
/// - 2016/08/03 (1.04.0) - Added `NK_WINDOW_BACKGROUND` flag to force a window

///                        simplify memory management by removing the need to
///                        allocate the pool.
/// - 2016/07/29 (1.02.0) - Added auto scrollbar hiding window flag which if enabled
///                        will hide the window scrollbar after NK_SCROLLBAR_HIDING_TIMEOUT
///                        seconds without window interaction. To make it work
///                        you have to also set a delta time inside the `nk_context`.
/// - 2016/07/25 (1.01.1) - Fixed small panel and panel border drawing bugs.
/// - 2016/07/15 (1.01.0) - Added software cursor to `nk_style` and `nk_context`.

/// - 2016/07/15 (1.01.0) - Removed internal font baking API and simplified
///                        font atlas memory management by converting pointer
///                        arrays for fonts and font configurations to lists.
/// - 2016/07/15 (1.00.0) - Changed button API to use context dependend button
///                        behavior instead of passing it for every function call.
