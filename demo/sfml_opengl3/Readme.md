# SFML 2.4 nuklear backend

This backend provides support for [SFML 2.4](http://www.sfml-dev.org). It will work on all platforms supported by SFML.

## Compiling

Once SFML has been installed on your system you have to edit the Makefile provided so that you can build the demo. There is one variable that needs to be edited: SFML_DIR. Make this point to your SFML root folder.

On Linux there is an extra step. You need to install the udev development files.
